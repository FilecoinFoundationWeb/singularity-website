# Singularity Website

## Overview
---
This is the repo for the Singularity marketing site.

- This repo represents a static site which requires compilation, but can then be served as a static resource
- This site can be hosted on any resource supporting static files, but may include some services that require a serverless node
- The site itself is served statically, but internal navigation is virtualized in the browser: in other words, the site acts as an SPA when browsed on the client
- While a static site, this app can be extended at any time to a full application by changing the target in settings
